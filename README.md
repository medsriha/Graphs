# Graphs
Implementation  Djisktra's algorithm for finding single-source shortest paths in the graph, and the PageRank algorithm for determining the importance of nodes in the network.


We created our own Graph class that mimics some of the functionality of networkx (and which will indeed be much faster than networkx when it comes to algorithms like PageRank).
